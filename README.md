# Building a Real Life Production ML System

The idea of this repo was to implement almost all of the stuff I had learnt and build a production level machine learning system or pipeline.
Mainly, the idea was to create an automated workflow containing the following steps:

- Feature Pipeline
- Training Pipeline
- Inference Pipeline

To run the repo, create a conda environment using this command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
